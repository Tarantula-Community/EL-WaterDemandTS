# Ensemble Learning applied to Water Demand Time Series

The repository reports some applications of ensemble learning methods to water demand time series. The applications aims to show how ensemble learnig methods may be used to combine multiple machine learning techniques to improve the solution of regression and classification problems, with practical applications to a real case study, using high resolution water-flow measures.
